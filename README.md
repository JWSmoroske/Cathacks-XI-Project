# Overview
CyberInfo AI (CIAI) is an all-in-one Android app that helps users become educated on cybersecurity practices.

# Features
- Educational resources to learn about cybersecurity
- AI powered cybersecurity assistant
- Quiz yourself on cybersecurity topics

# Why CIAI?
CIAI was our first step into native app development, and our first experience with Kotlin programming.
It was also an opportunity to realize our skills in a different context (AI integration, UI/UX design, etc.).
